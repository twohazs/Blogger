<h2>This is My First Article</h2>

<p class="quote">Your copies could do with a provocative writing style that could resonate very deeply with these investors, making use of STATISTICS and MARKET ANAYLYTICS to sway your potential investors into seeing why funding your start-up is not just the right choice, but a NO-BRAINER.

For example, I once wrote a pitch for a real estate app. But instead of talking about all the cool stuff the app could do, I came up with a ”hook” about how the app could help the average Joe makes a smart home buying decision on his income and credit score.</p>

<p>Preselling involves less pressure to push for the sale because you both know that the person on the other end of the screen pretty much wants to make a purchase… they just need a little nudge to know for sure it’s the right fit.
Moving on, there’re more copywriting formulas than fishes in the sea. So, knowing the right copywriting formula for the right marketing strategy is an agonizingly underestimated requirement of masterful copywriting - the right balance is vital. 
You need a no-bullshit, gets-you-in-feelings sales copywriter in your corner to achieve your sales targets. (Slowly raising my hand)</p>

<p>Bedtime stories are an all-time favorite of mine. It's pretty fun to write, you know, just introduce the character, conflict, and theme right away, and keep it clean, especially as it is that - A BEDTIME STORY - to drive you to sleep. So, while some old-timey bedtime tales are steeped in violence, lay off subjects including death, or blood, gory scenes, and the likes. a good bedtime story would have a satisfying ending that makes you go, “Ahh.” And no animals would die in it. Ever.” lol</p>

<p class="quote1">I see you require the services of a detail-obsessed, expert-level essay writer to proofread and edit your essay, and add a compelling conclusion to state your case emphatically in a way that resonates with the reader. This project needs to be handled by someone with linguistic proficiency, a keen eye for details, and a truckload of experience in writing academic and non-academic essays.</p>

<p>I could go on all day, telling you about the psychology of online sales and the importance of storytelling for connecting with your audience. After all, conversion-focused copywriting is my expertise. However, I know you’re not here for a web copywriting lesson, you’re here for RESULTS, and that’s what I provide.</p>
